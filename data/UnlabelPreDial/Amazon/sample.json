Remember this is not like eating hard candy, it is a supplement. So it also says keep away from children so they don't confuse it with hard candy. I used two while flying partly cause my mouth was dry and I wanted assurance I wouldn't get sick, all I did was let it melt in my mouth. I drink diet Ginger ale all the time, yet I hate gingerbread cookies, gingersnap type, these did not have a strong flavor to them. I don't know if I mentioned I went on a short cruise, which the crew said it was the roughest the seas had been in 6 months, I ended up giving some to two employees because they were getting seasick and they helped them too.Hope I answered enough for you, if not ask anything about them, I will answer again.
